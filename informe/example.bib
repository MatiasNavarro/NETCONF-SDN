	Abstract = {We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of B4, a private WAN connecting Google’s data centers across the planet. B4 has a number of unique characteristics: i) massive bandwidth requirements deployed to a modest number of sites, ii) elastic traf- fic demand that seeks to maximize average bandwidth, and iii) full control over the edge servers and network, which enables rate limiting and demand measurement at the edge. ese characteristics led to a Soware Defined Networking architecture using OpenFlow to control relatively simple switches built from merchant silicon. B4’s centralized traffic engineering service drives links to near 100% utilization, while splitting application flows among multiple paths to balance capacity against application priority/demands. We describe experience with three years of B4 production deployment, lessons learned, and areas for future work.},
