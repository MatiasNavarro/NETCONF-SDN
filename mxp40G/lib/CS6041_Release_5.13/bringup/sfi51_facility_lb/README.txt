This script is a 40G facility loopback on Module B SFI5.1.  The payload is sourced from an external
tester.  It is looped back internally at the far edge of the HSIF block and sent back towards the tester.
This is a good script to use to check interface connectivity and Serdes lock.


A SYSCLK of 425 MHz is assumed.  Please contact your Cortina AE for any other rates you may need.
